### Overview of My XAMPP Alternative

Welcome to my XAMPP alternative project! This is a personal project born out of frustration with XAMPP and created purely for fun and out of boredom. The project is currently incomplete, and I'm working on it in my free time.

#### Current Features:
- **Apache and MySQL Setup**: Basic configuration and setup for Apache and MySQL.
- **PowerShell Scripts**: Simplified scripts to start and stop Apache and MySQL services.

#### Planned Features:
- **Electron UI**: I plan to integrate an Electron-based user interface to provide a more user-friendly experience. This will be done at a later stage.

#### Disclaimer:
This project is not intended for production use. It is a work in progress and should be used with caution. Contributions and feedback are welcome, as this is a learning and exploration exercise.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or just have a look at how it works. Thanks for stopping by!

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Run Setup Script**:
   Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   .\Setup.ps1
   ```

3. **Start Apache and MySQL Services**:
   Use the provided PowerShell scripts to start and stop the services:
   ```powershell
   .\StartApache.ps1
   .\StopApache.ps1
   .\StartMySQL.ps1
   .\StopMySQL.ps1
   ```

### Future Plans
- Integrate a full-featured Electron-based UI to manage services.
- Add more features and improve stability.
